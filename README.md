# Whistle Map MVP

1. Whistle Map is a simple web app where users can drop events or needs (called whistles) like buy, sell, help, party, or misc on Google Maps.  
2. The map loads centered on Chennai by default, and users can search for places or click on the map to set a location for their whistle.  
3. Each whistle includes details like title, category, price, description, contact, and expiry, and is saved in the browser using localStorage.  
4. Whistles appear as colored markers on the map, and users can filter markers by category or view details in info windows.  
5. The app allows exporting all whistles to a JSON file, importing from a JSON file, and clearing all whistles with confirmation.  
6. The project is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using the Google Maps JavaScript API and Places API, with future plans for iOS/Android in Flutter.
